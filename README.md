# Movie Tracker

### Hosted @ [Heroku](https://movietracker-turing.herokuapp.com/)

  This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies.
